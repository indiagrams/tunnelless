# Apple Distribution cert SHA-1 resolver — shared across release pipelines.
#
# DO NOT EDIT DIVERGENTLY. Byte-identical copies live in this template and in
# downstream consumer projects that derive from it. Each project pins this
# file's SHA-256 in its own `ci/lib/SHA256SUMS`; ci/local-check.sh fails the
# build if the local copy drifts from the pinned hash.
#
# When you change one project's copy, propagate the same edit to every other
# project that consumes it within the same release cycle — otherwise the
# consumer projects' next CI run will fail until they update.
#
# Any new project signing for an Apple Developer team can copy this file
# as-is and adopt the same `verify_helpers_in_sync` check pattern.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
# ---------------
# The `Apple Distribution: <name> (<team-id>)` common name is shared across
# every Apple Distribution cert issued to that team. When a developer machine
# carries certs for multiple apps under the same team,
# `codesign --sign "Apple Distribution"` and exportArchive's
# `signingCertificate: "Apple Distribution"` both become ambiguous and pick
# one randomly. Symptoms:
#   - exportArchive: "Provisioning profile X doesn't include signing
#     certificate Y" (it picked the cert from the other project)
#   - codesign:      "Apple Distribution: ambiguous (matches A and B in
#     login.keychain-db)"
#
# Pin to the exact SHA-1 listed in the App Store distribution profile
# (`DeveloperCertificates` field of the .mobileprovision/.provisionprofile
# plist). That SHA-1 is project-specific and stable across cert rotations
# as long as the profile is up to date.
#
# USAGE
# -----
#   . ci/lib/resolve-dist-cert-sha.sh
#
#   # Pre-build path (when you know the profile name; needed for iOS
#   # exportArchive's ExportOptions.plist signingCertificate field):
#   sha=$(resolve_dist_cert_sha_from_profile_name "Butler iOS App Store Distribution")
#
#   # Post-build path (more reliable; reads the profile actually embedded in
#   # the built .app — guaranteed to match what Xcode chose at archive time):
#   sha=$(resolve_dist_cert_sha_from_app "$EXPANDED_APP")
#
# Both functions echo the SHA-1 (uppercase hex) to stdout on success.
# On failure they echo a diagnostic to stderr and return non-zero — callers
# should `set -e` or check the exit code; this library does not call `exit`
# so it stays composable.

# Internal: extract the SHA-1 of the first DeveloperCertificate from a
# .mobileprovision / .provisionprofile file path.
