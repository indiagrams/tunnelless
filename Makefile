# Developer entry points for the iOS + macOS template.
#
# Forking your own app from this template? The path is:
#
#   1. gh repo create my-app --template indiagrams/apple-shipkit --public --clone
#   2. cd my-app && make bootstrap   # one-time dev-env setup (brew + ruby gems + xcodegen + git hooks)
#   3. make init                     # scaffolds .bootstrap.env (auto-fills GH_ORG/GH_APP_REPO from origin)
#   4. $EDITOR .bootstrap.env        # fill in APP_NAME, BUNDLE_ID, Apple credentials, RELEASE_MODE
#   5. make all                      # doctor → bootstrap-fork → ship → verify (the full forker journey)
#
# Maintaining this template? `make check` runs the local CI check, lefthook
# wires it onto every push, and `make doctor` validates `.bootstrap.env` end
# to end without mutating any state.

# Pin Ruby to .ruby-version so every recipe in this Makefile uses the same
# Ruby that `bundle install` ran under during `make bootstrap`. Without
# this, brew's unversioned `/opt/homebrew/opt/ruby` symlink moves with each
# major Ruby release (May 2026: bumped 3.3 → 4.0), so a forker who ran
# `make bootstrap` under Ruby 3.3 then later ran `make screenshots` under
# Ruby 4.0 would hit `Could not find fastlane-2.230.0, ... in locally
# installed gems` because bundler under 4.0 looks at vendor/bundle/ruby/4.0.0/
# while gems are at vendor/bundle/ruby/3.3.0/. Reading .ruby-version makes
# the pin auto-track the project's declared Ruby; the wildcard guard means
# forks not using brew Ruby (system Ruby, asdf, mise, rtx, rbenv) see no
# behavior change.
#
# Why $(_BUNDLE) and not bare `bundle`: GNU make has a "single-line recipe
# optimization" that calls execvp() directly (bypassing /bin/sh) for simple
# recipe lines with no shell metachars. The `export PATH := ...` directive
# only affects PATH for shell-mediated invocations; direct execvp uses the
# make process's parent env PATH unchanged. On a forker's machine where the
# parent shell PATH has /usr/bin (system Ruby 2.6 + Bundler 1.17.2) before
# /opt/homebrew/opt/ruby@3.3/bin, bare `bundle install` resolves to
# /usr/bin/bundle = system Bundler 1.17.2, which writes a flat
# vendor/bundle/ layout (Bundler 1.x style) with extensions compiled for
# Ruby 2.6 ABI. Then every subsequent `bundle check` from Bundler 4.x +
# Ruby 3.3 reports "missing gems" because it's looking in
# vendor/bundle/ruby/3.3.0/ which doesn't exist. Absolute-path $(_BUNDLE)
# bypasses the PATH lookup entirely and routes the call through the
# brew-Ruby bundle shim's shebang (#!/path/to/ruby@3.3/bin/ruby), which
# guarantees Bundler 4.x + Ruby 3.3 do the install with the modern
# vendor/bundle/ruby/3.3.0/ layout. Forks not using brew Ruby fall back
# to bare `bundle` (the else branch) — their version manager's shim
# handles the resolution correctly.
_RUBY_VER := $(shell cat .ruby-version 2>/dev/null || echo 3.3)
_RUBY_MM := $(shell echo $(_RUBY_VER) | awk -F. '{ print $$1 "." $$2 }')
_RUBY_BIN := /opt/homebrew/opt/ruby@$(_RUBY_MM)/bin

# Per-fork configuration lives in each clone's in-repo `.bootstrap.env` (gitignored,
# `.bootstrap.env.example` is the schema). Ruby drivers under bin/ read it directly
# via Bootstrap::Config.load!; fastlane lanes read it via `_fork_config` helper
# in fastlane/Fastfile.
#
# To share values across multiple forks on the same machine (cross-fork ASC API
# key, team ID, App Review contact info), use any of:
#   - direnv .envrc per fork directory
#   - shell profile exports (~/.zshrc, ~/.bashrc)
#   - 1Password CLI / pass / etc. piped into the shell
#   - per-invocation: APP_REVIEW_FIRST_NAME="Foo" make submit
# The template deliberately does NOT auto-source any file outside the fork —
# baking a specific filesystem layout into the template was confusing forkers
# and silently leaking per-fork keys (BUNDLE_ID etc.) across fork boundaries.

# `brew bundle` may have just installed ruby@3.3 for the first time on a fresh
# machine. The $(_BUNDLE) variable was resolved at Makefile-PARSE time (via
# $(wildcard ...) above), which pre-dates the install — so on a host where the
# parent shell PATH already had system Ruby 2.6 but no brew Ruby yet,
# $(_BUNDLE) froze as plain `bundle`. Running that here resolves through PATH
# to /usr/bin/bundle = system Bundler 1.17.2 on Ruby 2.6.10, which refuses to
# install modern gems with "public_suffix-7.0.5 requires ruby version >= 3.2".
# Surfaced 2026-05-11 on a fresh macOS host that hadn't seen ruby@3.3 before.
#
# Re-execing $(MAKE) for the bundle install re-parses the Makefile from
# scratch with /opt/homebrew/opt/ruby@3.3/bin/ruby now visible to
# $(wildcard ...), so _BUNDLE picks up the absolute brew-Ruby path and the
# install resolves to Bundler 4.x + Ruby 3.3. Harmless ~50ms no-op on
# machines where ruby@3.3 was already installed at the outer make's parse
# time. The internal `_bootstrap-bundle` target is the re-exec landing zone.
