# Audit Apple's valid signing-cert list (distribution + development) against
# the user's login.keychain and (with confirmation) revoke the Apple-side
# certs whose private keys live nowhere on the user's Mac.
#
# Why this exists: Apple caps both Distribution (3 per team) and Development
# (~2 per registered device) signing certs. Each CI release run mints a fresh
# set and revokes them in an `if: always()` post-step, but the post-step can
# be skipped (runner evicted mid-run, hard crash, cache-evicted tracking file
# >7 days idle). Over time, the team accumulates Apple-side cert IDs whose
# private keys live nowhere. The next release run then hits one of:
#   [!] Could not create another Distribution certificate, reached the maximum
#       number of available Distribution certificates.
#   [!] Could not create another Development certificate, reached the maximum
#       number of available Development certificates.
# at the minting step. Previously the only recovery was the developer.apple.com
# web UI (~30 sec but error-prone — easy to revoke a cert that IS in use
# elsewhere). This script makes the recovery local + scriptable + safe.
#
# Safety guard: only certs whose serial number is NOT present in
# ~/Library/Keychains/login.keychain-db are flagged. If your Mac has the cert,
# you can use it for signing somewhere — so it's not an orphan and won't be
# touched.
#
# Usage:
#   bundle exec ruby bin/revoke-orphan-certs.rb              # interactive prompt
#   bundle exec ruby bin/revoke-orphan-certs.rb --yes        # revoke without prompt
#   bundle exec ruby bin/revoke-orphan-certs.rb --dry-run    # list orphans, don't revoke
#
# Used by: `make revoke-orphan-certs`. Loads `.bootstrap.env`, sets the
# ASC_API_KEY_* env vars via Bootstrap.asc_env, invokes the
# `revoke_orphan_certs` fastlane lane.

ARGV.each do |arg|

      Usage: bundle exec ruby bin/revoke-orphan-certs.rb [--yes] [--dry-run]

      Revoke Apple-side distribution certs whose private keys are not present
      in your local login.keychain. Only flags orphans — never revokes a cert
      whose private key exists on this Mac.

      Options:
        --yes, -y       Skip the confirmation prompt.
        --dry-run, -n   List orphans, don't revoke.
        --help, -h      Show this message.

      Driven by Makefile target `make revoke-orphan-certs`.
