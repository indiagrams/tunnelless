#!/usr/bin/env bash
# bin/setup-github.sh — apply standard GitHub configuration (branch protection, squash, auto-merge) to a
# repo derived from this template.
#
# What it sets:
#   - Default branch: main
#   - Branch protection on main:
#       * Require PR before merging (no direct pushes)
#       * Require status checks (swiftlint + swiftformat + per-generator
#         app cells — xcodegen if app/project.yml is committed, tuist if
#         app/Project.swift is committed; both manifests = both check sets)
#       * Require status checks to be up-to-date before merge
#       * Enforce on admins (no bypass — same rules apply to repo owner)
#       * Require linear history
#   - Disable merge commits + rebase merges (squash-only)
#   - Auto-delete head branches after merge
#
# Usage:
#   bin/setup-github.sh                              # uses current repo's origin
#   bin/setup-github.sh owner/repo                   # explicit target
#
# Prerequisites:
#   - gh CLI authenticated with admin:repo scope (`gh auth status` shows it)
#   - You are the repo admin (or an org admin)
#
# Idempotent — safe to re-run; existing settings are overwritten with these.

      GitHub gates branch protection on PRIVATE repos behind paid plans.
      Your repo '$REPO' is private and on the free plan, so the PUT
      returned HTTP 403. Repo settings (squash-only merge, auto-delete head
      branches, auto-merge) WERE applied successfully — only the
      protection rules were skipped.

      Three options:

        A) Make the repo public (free, protection works immediately):
             gh repo edit $REPO --visibility public --accept-visibility-change-consequences

        B) Upgrade to GitHub Pro (\$4/mo for private repos + protection):
             https://github.com/settings/billing/plans

        C) Accept no protection — fine for solo work. Trade-off: anyone
           with write access can push directly to main without a PR or CI
           gate. \`make doctor\` will continue to surface this as ⚠ advisory.

      For (C), no further action needed — \`make bootstrap-fork\` continues
      to the remaining steps.
