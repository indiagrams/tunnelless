# ci/take-screenshots.sh — capture App Store screenshots (iOS + macOS).
#
# iOS uses fastlane snapshot (Snapfile). macOS uses xcodebuild test +
# extract-mac-screenshots.sh (fastlane snapshot is iOS-only).
#
# Usage:
#   ci/take-screenshots.sh                    # iOS + macOS, no upload
#   ci/take-screenshots.sh --upload           # iOS + macOS, then upload to ASC
#   ci/take-screenshots.sh --ios-only         # skip macOS
#   ci/take-screenshots.sh --macos-only       # skip iOS
#
# Output: fastlane/screenshots/en-US/*.png  (flat — deliver only globs en-US/*.png
# and a few hardcoded subdirectories; arbitrary subfolders are silently ignored)

  # On forks where the project.yml still has DEVELOPMENT_TEAM=TEAM_ID_PLACEHOLDER
  # (no real Apple team set yet — typical fresh-fork state), Xcode's automatic
  # signing fails: "No signing certificate Mac Development found ... team ID
  # TEAM_ID_PLACEHOLDER". The same xcodebuild used in CI matrix jobs
  # (.github/workflows/pr.yml + ci/local-check.sh) passes
  # CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY="" + CODE_SIGNING_REQUIRED=NO + CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO
  # to bypass signing entirely — UI tests don't need real signatures to run.
  # Mirror that here so screenshots work on fresh forks regardless of whether
  # the user has minted real Mac Development certs.

  # Split build and test into two phases so we can clear macOS Gatekeeper
  # quarantine on the runner between them. Some host configurations leave a
  # `com.apple.quarantine` xattr on the freshly-built MacOSUITests-Runner.app
  # (most often: Xcode installed via xcodes-cli/.xip carries quarantine on
  # the .app itself and propagates it to frameworks copied into the test
  # bundle; AV/EDR software writing xattrs on new files; cloud-sync metadata
  # on the build path). macOS Gatekeeper then refuses to launch the runner
  # with "<APP>MacOSUITests-Runner is damaged and can't be opened." Surfaced
  # 2026-05-11 on a fresh teammate's MacBook Pro. Stripping the xattr +
  # ad-hoc re-signing the runner between build-for-testing and
  # test-without-building reliably clears the rejection on every host
  # configuration we've tested. Idempotent / no-op on hosts where the xattr
  # isn't present.
