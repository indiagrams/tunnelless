import XCTest

// `AccessibilityIdentifiers` (app/Shared/AccessibilityIdentifiers.swift)
// is compiled into BOTH the main app target (HelloApp-iOS) and this UI test
// target via xcodegen's / Tuist's `sources:` list — same file path, two
// targets. UI tests run as a separate process and can't link the main
// app's binary, so the usual `@testable import` pattern doesn't apply.
// Compiling the one shared file into both targets is the standard
// workaround; single source of truth preserved.

/// Drives App Store screenshot capture via fastlane snapshot.
///
/// **Per-appearance test functions, not one looping test.** Fastlane runs
/// each function as a separate test invocation and sets the simulator's
/// appearance BEFORE the app launches, so the app boots directly in light
/// or dark mode — no relaunch, no flicker. This also means:
///
///   - Parallel: light and dark can run on different simulators simultaneously.
///   - Independent failure: if dark breaks, light still captures.
///   - Independent re-run: `fastlane snapshot --only_testing
///     HelloAppUITests/AppStoreScreenshotTests/testLightMode` when iterating.
///
/// **Selector contract.** Never query by visible text — see
/// `AccessibilityIdentifiers.swift`. The constants there are the
/// project-wide single source of truth, refactor-safe and locale-proof.
///
/// **Output.** `fastlane/screenshots/en-US/<device>-<NN>-<test>.png`.
/// Both light and dark captures land in the same `en-US/` directory;
/// deliver uploads everything. App Store Connect's 10-screenshot-per-class
/// limit applies — at 2 screens × 2 appearances × N languages, you have
/// (10 / appearances) screens of headroom per language.
