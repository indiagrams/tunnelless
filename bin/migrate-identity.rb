# Migrate a fork that ran the old rename onto the config-based identity scheme —
# and REFUSE, by name, on any tree whose state it cannot read.
#
# WHAT THIS COMMAND DOES
#
# It reads a fork's tree, decides which of three states it is in, and says so:
#
#   never-migrated        none of the four signals present — the population this
#                         command exists for: a pre-#281 fork that ran the rename
#                         and carries its own token in project, schemes, targets,
#                         the @main struct and the entitlements filenames
#   already fully migrated  all four signals present — nothing to do, reported
#                         LOUDLY and never as a bare exit 0
#   partially migrated    any mixture — refused, naming every mixed signal
#
# WHAT THIS FILE DOES
#
# The VALUE half: it reads the fork's identity from what the build
# actually resolves, writes app/Identity.xcconfig and proves the write by reading
# it back through the one parser, and relocates the Apple Team ID into gitignored
# app/Local.xcconfig behind a git-confirmed ignore gate.
#
# The STRUCTURAL half: five history-preserving `git mv`s and the
# declarations inside the moved files, both manifests rewritten so every identity
# setting is a $(VAR) reference into app/Identity.xcconfig rather than a literal,
# the .gitignore project paths, the stale generated project removed and its
# absence PROVEN, regeneration, and finally the tree's own identity gate run and
# required to exit 0.
#
# The ENTRY-POINT half: every OTHER tracked file outside app/ that
# names the fork's generated project or one of its app schemes, so the migrated
# fork can still run `make check`, `make ship` and `make screenshots`. The runbook
# measured what the command left behind without it — ci/local-check.sh:68 still
# handing app/<N>.xcodeproj to `xcodebuild -project` on a tree that held only
# app/App.xcodeproj — and criterion 1's "ONE documented command" does not survive
# a command that leaves the fork's own tooling broken. See the block above
# ENTRY_POINT_EXCLUDED for the two token classes, the exclusions and their reasons.
#
# All of it sits behind bin/rename.sh's gate order and on top of a port of its
# atomic rollback, so a failure anywhere in that sequence restores the tree
# rather than leaving it half migrated.
#
# THE ONE THING THE STRUCTURAL HALF MUST NOT DO
#
# In a pre-#281 fork, structure and identity are THE SAME TOKEN. A reverse sweep
# that rewrote every occurrence of the token would take the forker's own choices
# with it: app/Shared/AccessibilityIdentifiers.swift's "<N>.title" is a UI-test
# selector, app/Shared/Localizable.xcstrings' key is user-visible, and
# app/Shared/ContentView.swift's Text("<N>") is what the running app draws. So
# the sites are ENUMERATED, no glob in this file writes anything, and the suite
# asserts those files' SHA-256 digests across a migration.
#
# WHY THE IDENTITY IS READ FROM THE BUILD AND NOT FROM THE MANIFESTS
#
# xcodebuild -showBuildSettings is the only source that reports what the build
# actually RESOLVES. A literal baked into a generated .pbxproj shadows the
# manifest that was supposed to produce it, and CHANGELOG.md:55 records that
# exact defect in this repository — XcodeGen wrote a host target name into
# TEST_HOST at generation time while PRODUCT_NAME resolved at build time, and
# every file-level check was green about it. This work assigned "reading
# the fork's current identity" to the build tier for the same reason. The
# manifests are used only as the cross-check: the collapsed PRODUCT_NAME must
# equal the structural token the three derivations above already agreed on, and
# a disagreement is a refusal rather than a guess.
#
# TWO FIXTURE KNOBS, BOTH ANNOUNCING, NEITHER SET BY CI
#
#   MIGRATE_IDENTITY_TOOL_DIR=<dir>
#     Resolves xcodebuild and xcodegen from <dir> instead of PATH, so
#     test/migrate_identity_test.rb can exercise the whole mutation phase on a
#     runner with no Xcode. git is deliberately NOT resolved through it: the
#     rollback is a git operation and a knob that could substitute git would be
#     a knob that could substitute the rollback.
#
#   MIGRATE_IDENTITY_FAIL_AFTER=xcconfig-write|team-id-move|entry-points
#     Raises after the named mutation stage, which is the only way to reach the
#     rollback path from a test without breaking this command on purpose. An
#     unknown stage is exit 1, not a silent no-op.
#
# Both print a two-line banner on stderr before any work, the shape
# bin/lib/bootstrap.rb:604-611 established for IDENTITY_XCCONFIG. A silent knob
# is a way to disable a gate without anything going red, so the suite asserts
# both the banner and its ABSENCE on a default run.
#
# WHY THE DETECTOR IS NEW RATHER THAN BORROWED
#
# bin/rename.sh's check_idempotency counts file paths and returns a bare 0/1/2
# with no message — a partial tree reported as a number. Upstream's post-#281
# rewrite of it keys on ONE signal, app/Identity.xcconfig, with the comment "the
# project structure is a constant, so file paths say nothing about whether a
# rename happened". That is true after #281 and false before it, which is
# precisely the tree this command is pointed at: on a pre-#281 renamed fork the
# single-signal detector answers "not migrated" for the right reason and
# "migrated" for the wrong one. The four signals below were measured across seven
# refs.
#
# WHERE IT LIVES
#
# bin/, alongside preflight-identity.rb and lib/xcconfig.rb, the two other Ruby
# entry points a forker runs directly.
#
# WHY RUBY AND NOT BASH
#
# bin/lib/xcconfig.rb — the one xcconfig reader this command is required to use
# (AGENTS.md:277-292) — is Ruby with zero require lines, and
# bin/preflight-identity.rb, whose refusal shape this command copies, is Ruby. A bash
# implementation would need a fifth reader or a shell-out per key. The accepted
# cost is porting bin/rename.sh's trap-based rollback, ~30 lines.
# /usr/bin/ruby is 2.6.10 and is never used; both pinned interpreters
# (/opt/homebrew/opt/ruby@3.3/bin/ruby 3.3.12 and
# /opt/homebrew/opt/ruby@4.0/bin/ruby 4.0.6) must pass test/migrate_identity_test.rb.
#
# WHY A ONE-TIME MIGRATION COMMAND IS IN SCOPE UPSTREAM
#
# SCOPE.md's test is "does this addition require modifying Swift source files to
# use it?" (SCOPE.md:11) and SCOPE.md:32 lists "fork-rename scripts" among the
# in-scope developer-experience helpers. This command edits a Swift file — the
# @main struct's name — which looks at first glance like the shape SCOPE.md bars.
# It is not: that edit is the command's one-time OUTPUT, not a precondition of
# using it. Nobody has to open a Swift file to run this, and nothing it installs
# has to be wired into app code afterwards. A rename script that renames source
# has always been in scope by the same reading; this is that script's successor,
# pointed the other way. The argument is made explicitly here so the upstream
# pull request can be reviewed on it rather than on an implicit claim.
#
# Exit-code contract:
#
#   Exit | Meaning                                              | Message must name
#   -----+------------------------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------
#   0    | migrated successfully, OR already fully migrated,     | every satisfied signal; the detected
#        | reported LOUDLY and never silently                    | structural token on a --dry-run
#   1    | unknown or malformed argv, or an unknown value for   | the offending argument or knob value, and
#        | one of the two fixture knobs                         | the usage line or the valid stages
#   2    | the tree at --root is not one this command            | the resolved absolute path and the CWD;
#        | understands: missing, not a directory, no             | for a token disagreement, every value found;
#        | app/project.yml, no readable `name:`, a structural    | for a broken include, the include; for a
#        | token that cannot be read the same way twice, an      | build-settings problem, the scheme and the
#        | app/Identity.xcconfig that cannot be resolved, a      | configuration; for a written-then-unreadable
#        | build-settings dump that cannot be read              | value, the key, the intended and the resolved
#        | unambiguously, two platforms that disagree about a   |
#        | value there is only one of, or — on a mutating run   |
#        | only — not a git repository                          |
#   3    | partially migrated: a mixture of migrated and         | every mixed signal, comma-separated, and
#        | un-migrated state, including a present-but-           | every missing identity variable
#        | incomplete app/Identity.xcconfig                       |
#   4    | a mutation-phase refusal: a gate in front of the      | what would have been migrated and why it
#        | mutation (toolchain, clean tree, on main, no          | was not; for a manifest whose shape cannot
#        | generated project, a Team ID that must not be         | be rewired, the rule and the count that fell
#        | written), a must-not-touch file that is not there,     | short; for a surviving stale project, its
#        | a manifest this command cannot rewire, a stale        | path; for an entry-point file, its path and
#        | generated project that survives its removal, an       | the reference that survived the rewrite;
#        | entry-point file this command enumerated and then     | and always that the tree was rolled back
#        | could not rewrite or could not verify rewritten, a    |
#        | failed git mv or generation, a migrated tree that     |
#        | fails its own identity gate, or an injected fixture   |
#        | failure                                               |
#
# Exit 2 versus exit 3 restates the convention at
# bin/preflight-identity.rb:32-48: "not found" is a distinct outcome from
# "checked and wrong", and it gets a distinct code, so "this tree was never
# understood" can never be read as "this tree checked out".
#
# Exit 4 exists for a measured reason rather than a stylistic one. Ruby exits 1
# with a backtrace on ANY uncaught exception (measured 2026-09-03 under both
# pinned interpreters), and exit 1 is spoken for by malformed argv — so a caller
# branching on the code would read "the migration blew up" as "you called me
# wrong", the shape 03-REVIEW IN-01 found when a directory at --config produced
# an EISDIR backtrace instead of the contract's exit 2. Every mutation-phase
# failure is therefore rolled back and re-reported as exit 4, with the exception
# class, its message and its backtrace all printed rather than swallowed.
#
# Usage:
#   ruby bin/migrate-identity.rb --dry-run              # detect this repository, write nothing
#   ruby bin/migrate-identity.rb --root PATH --dry-run  # detect the tree at PATH (fixtures)
#   ruby bin/migrate-identity.rb --root PATH            # migrate it
#
# Ruby core only, TWO require-family lines and no gem: `require "rbconfig"` (core
# stdlib — see the note beside it, and the measurement that made it explicit) and
# a require_relative of a sibling in this repository that itself has zero
# requires, not even stdlib (test/xcconfig_test.rb asserts that, so it cannot
# rot). Nothing outside core is loaded on any path, which is what lets
# the stdlib-only CI jobs keep bundler-cache: false. Do NOT add a YAML
# gem to read app/project.yml, or a Swift parser to read app/Project.swift: both
# manifests are read and rewritten line-orientedly below for exactly that reason.
#
# RESCUE POLICY. Every rescue in this file names a class and is commented with
# what it is for. Two name Xcconfig::MissingInclude ("your include is broken"
# must never arrive as "that key is empty") and one names
# FixtureInjectedFailure. The one remaining `rescue StandardError` wraps the
# MUTATION PHASE ONLY and is not a silent tolerance: it prints the exception's
# class, message and full backtrace, rolls the tree back, and re-reports as the
# contract's exit 4 — because the alternative is Ruby's uncaught-exception exit
# 1, which the contract reserves for "you called me wrong", on a tree that has
# already been half rewritten. Nothing outside the mutation phase is rescued.
#
# The NotImplementedError raise-and-rescue pair left here, with
# an instruction to delete itself, is GONE: this plan implements the body it
# stood in for, and leaving it would have swallowed a genuine NotImplementedError
# raised from deeper inside the migration.

# Ruby core, and the ONLY stdlib require in this file. It exists for exactly one
# line: the post-migration identity gate is run through RbConfig.ruby — the
# interpreter running THIS process — never through PATH's `ruby`, which on a bare
# shell here is /usr/bin/ruby 2.6.10. MEASURED 2026-09-03: `ruby --disable-gems
# -e 'p RbConfig.ruby'` raises NameError, so RbConfig is NOT ambiently available
# and relying on rubygems having loaded it would be inferring a fact from a
# default. It pulls in no gem, so the stdlib-only CI jobs keep
# bundler-cache: false.

#
# The rule is unchanged: the Apple Team ID is written only to a path GIT confirms
# is ignored, and `git check-ignore -q` is the arbiter. 0 = ignored, 1 = not
# ignored, 128 = fatal; a 128 is evidence for NEITHER side and is a refusal
# (test/identity_test.rb:338-339 states that rule, and this is the write it
# exists to protect).
#
# What changed is what happens on a 1. MEASURED 2026-09-03:
#
#   git show 212b489:.gitignore  ->  no app/Local.xcconfig row, at all
#
# app/Local.xcconfig is a POST-#281 concept, so no pre-#281 fork has a row for
# it — and a command that refuses on a missing row would refuse every single tree
# in the population it exists to serve. So it CREATES the condition and then asks
# git again rather than asking once and giving up. git is still the arbiter; this
# command just stops requiring the forker to do its setup by hand.
#
# The refusal is still reachable, and on the case that actually matters. Also
# measured, on a scratch repository:
#
#   file TRACKED   + matching .gitignore row  ->  check-ignore exits 1
#   file untracked + matching row             ->  check-ignore exits 0
#   file untracked + no row                   ->  check-ignore exits 1
#
# git reports a TRACKED path as not-ignored whatever .gitignore says. A fork that
# has already committed app/Local.xcconfig therefore still gets a refusal, which
# is exactly right: writing a Team ID into a tracked file puts it in the next
# commit, and adding a row would not change that.

# --- the rest of the fork: the entry points outside app/ -----------------------
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS AT ALL. The runbook ran a real exit-0 migration on a real fixture
# and then measured the tree it produced. bin/rename.sh had substituted the fork's
# token across the whole tree; everything above rewrites app/ and .gitignore; and
# ci/local-check.sh:68 was still handing app/<N>.xcodeproj to `xcodebuild -project`
# while the tree held only app/App.xcodeproj with schemes App-iOS and App-macOS.
# `make check`, `make ship` and `make screenshots` were all broken on a fork that
# had run one documented command and done nothing else wrong. Criterion 1 says a
# fork "migrates by running ONE documented command"; a command that leaves the
# fork's own tooling broken satisfies the letter of that and not the sentence.
#
# EXACTLY TWO TOKEN CLASSES, BOTH ANCHORED, AND NOT A THIRD:
#
#   project path   <N>.xcodeproj  /  <N>.xcworkspace   ->  App.xcodeproj / App.xcworkspace
#   scheme name    <N>-iOS        /  <N>-macOS         ->  App-iOS       / App-macOS
#
# The token must be preceded by a non-identifier character and followed IMMEDIATELY
# by one of those four suffixes, with a non-identifier character after the scheme
# suffix. A bare <N> is never rewritten by anything here. That is the whole-tree
# sweep this phase exists to retire, and bin/rename.sh:518 carries its own comment
# about why it is dangerous — the same reason app/Shared/AccessibilityIdentifiers.
# swift, Localizable.xcstrings and ContentView.swift are on the frozen must-not-
# touch list above: in a pre-#281 fork, structure and identity are the same token,
# and only the SHAPE around an occurrence says which one it is.
#
# The two extensions are ONE class, not two. .gitignore lists them on adjacent
# lines, rewrite_gitignore has always rewritten them under a single rule with a
# single count, and they name the same generated project. Measured on a real
# fixture: AGENTS.md's `fastlane scan --workspace app/<N>.xcworkspace --scheme
# <N>-iOS` is one instruction, and rewriting half of it would be worse than
# rewriting neither.
#
# WHAT IS EXCLUDED, AND WHY EACH ONE:
#
#   app/**                 already rewritten above, by name, from a frozen list.
#   MUST_NOT_TOUCH         the forker's own choices; asserted byte-identical.
#   .gitignore             rewrite_gitignore owns it and requires a COUNT of 2. If
#                          this pass reached it first that count would fall short
#                          and the migration would refuse — so the exclusion is
#                          load-bearing, not tidiness, and the ordering in
#                          perform_migration is load-bearing with it.
#   CHANGELOG.md           historical record. Measured on a real
#                          fixture: its occurrences sit inside a quoted CI failure
#                          message from a dated 2026-05 entry and inside prose
#                          describing what the upstream template used to be called.
#                          Rewriting them would falsify a log line that was true
#                          when it was written. It is also not an entry point —
#                          nothing reads CHANGELOG.md to find a project.
#
# UNTRACKED AND GITIGNORED FILES ARE NOT REACHED, because the enumeration runs
# through `git ls-files`. That is deliberate: .bootstrap.env and app/Local.xcconfig
# are gitignored, the rollback restores tracked files with `git reset --hard`, and
