# ci/test-verify-rename.sh — integration self-test for bin/verify-rename.sh.
#
# Clones the live repo to a tmpdir, runs bin/rename.sh with test args,
# asserts bin/verify-rename.sh exits 0 silent (happy path), then mutates
# one tracked file to reintroduce a surface literal and asserts verify
# exits 1 with the byte-exact APP_NAME leak header. Restores the mutated
# file from a tmpdir snapshot (NOT via git checkout — see HIGH-Plan2-1
# below), then appends a marker to bin/rename.sh (a D-02 exclusion-list
# file) and asserts verify still exits 0 — the D-05 positive exclusion
# test that catches drift if the exclusion list ever expands or contracts.
#
# Cross-AI review closures (see 03-REVIEWS.md):
#   HIGH-Plan2-1 — restore README.md via `cp $WORK_DIR/README.md.post-rename`
#                  snapshot, NOT a git-based file restore (resetting the
#                  file to HEAD). HEAD is pre-rename in the tmpdir because
#                  rename.sh leaves changes uncommitted; restoring to it
#                  would re-leak all 5 surface literals into README and
#                  invalidate the D-05 test that runs immediately after.
#   MEDIUM-Plan2-5 — assert the byte-exact mutate-and-fail header
#                  `APP_NAME leak (1 match for "HelloApp"):`. Asserting
#                  only fragments would mask a singular/plural regression
#                  in bin/verify-rename.sh's check_surface helper.
#
# Usage:
#   ci/test-verify-rename.sh                # run from repo root
#
# Exit 0 = green; non-zero = a verification assertion failed.
#
# Wall-clock budget: < 30 seconds on macos-15 (SPEC AC-3).
