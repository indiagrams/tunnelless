# bin/verify-rename.sh — forker self-check for the apple-shipkit rename.
#
# Greps tracked files for the 4 original-template identity literals
# (APP_NAME, BUNDLE_ID, EMAIL, SLUG) and exits 0 silent if none remain,
# or 1 with a per-surface stderr report if any leak. Use after running
# bin/rename.sh on a fresh fork to confirm no Indiagrams strings
# survived the substitution.
#
# Usage:
#   bin/verify-rename.sh                # zero args; reads tracked files only
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 — all 4 surfaces clean (no matches in tracked files)
#   1 — any leak; per-surface stderr report + trailing summary
#
# Surfaces synced with bin/rename.sh's substitution-target enumeration.
# If rename.sh adds a surface, update both. (D-03 cross-reference.)
#
# DISPLAY_NAME shares 'HelloApp' literal with APP_NAME pre-rename;
# covered transitively by APP_NAME_ORIG (D-11).
#
# Self-reference exclusion (D-01, D-02):
#   The 5 :!path pathspecs below are the only files that retain
#   original-string literals post-rename by design (rename script + this
#   script + 3 test files). Hardcoded as :!pathspecs inside each
#   `git grep` call — no external ignore file, no constants array.
#
# Design note: 4 separate grep calls (one per surface) instead of one
# `git grep -e P1 -e P2 -e P3 -e P4`. Trade: 4 syscalls for trivial
# per-surface block assembly (D-09 grouped-by-surface stderr report).
# Single-call shape was rejected because classifying each match line
# by which `-e` pattern hit it requires error-prone post-hoc regex
# matching. See .planning/phases/03-verify-rename/03-01-PLAN.md
# <design_resolution> for the full rationale.
#
# Cross-AI review closures (see 03-REVIEWS.md):
#   HIGH-3   — git grep status-aware capture: distinguish exit 0 (matches)
#              from exit 1 (no matches) from exit ≥2 (real failure).
#              `|| true` would mask wrong-dir / not-in-git / bad-pathspec
#              into a silent exit 0 false-pass.
#   MEDIUM-1 — cd to REPO_ROOT before grepping; git rev-parse work-tree
#              gate so subdir / not-in-git invocations don't truncate scope.
#   MEDIUM-2 — pluralize correctly: "1 match" vs "N matches".
#   MEDIUM-3 — git grep -I to skip binaries (no "Binary file X matches").
#
# Constraints (parity with bin/rename.sh):
#   - bash 3.2+ (macOS default); no bash 4+ features
#   - git grep -I -F (binary-skip + fixed-literal); no regex on patterns
#   - tracked files only (git grep default; binaries auto-excluded by -I)
#   - no new external dependencies (git, bash, grep, sed)

# check_surface LABEL LITERAL
# Greps tracked files for LITERAL excluding 5 self-reference paths plus the
# bootstrap-doctor-matrix.yml workflow (whose `if: github.repository ==
# 'indiagrams/apple-shipkit'` safety guard is intentionally preserved on
# forks; bin/rename.sh excludes it from substitution, so verify-rename
# excludes it from the leak audit too — symmetric exclusion).
# On match: writes the D-09 block to stderr (header + indented matches).
# Always writes a single integer (the match count) to stdout.
# Returns 0 always (caller decides via the count, not the exit code).
#
# Co-location note (D-01): the 6 :!path exclusions are written inline
# here ONCE. The function body IS the single auditable source of truth
# for the exclusion list — calling this helper 4 times does not
# duplicate the audit surface, it reuses it.
#
# Cross-AI HIGH-3: do NOT use the always-true command-substitution
# fallback form. That masks ALL git grep failures (wrong-dir /
# not-in-git / bad pathspec collapse to silent exit 0 false pass).
# Use status-aware capture: accept exit 0 (matches) and exit 1 (no
# matches), fail on anything else.
#
# Cross-AI MEDIUM-3: -I flag skips binary files. Without it, a binary
# blob byte-coincidentally containing the literal prints
# `Binary file X matches` — not file:line:content, breaks D-09.
#
# Cross-AI MEDIUM-2: pluralize "1 match" vs "N matches" per D-09 example.
